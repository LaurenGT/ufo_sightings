# UFO Sightings

Using this website available in this repository, search for UFO sightings that were documented in the first two weeks of 2010. The options available are:

[Level_1](https://github.com/LaurenGT/ufo_sightings/tree/main/level_1) in which you can search solely using a date. By inputing a date in question, you will be shown all sightings that occured on that date.

[Level_2](https://github.com/LaurenGT/ufo_sightings/tree/main/level_2) in which you have five unique search criteria that you can use. By inputing any or all of the five search criteria, you will be shown all sightings that match what you requested.

## How to Use

Clone this repository to your local machine. Through the code editor of your choice, you can host either the [html for level_1](https://github.com/LaurenGT/ufo_sightings/blob/main/level_1/index.html) or the [html for level_2](https://github.com/LaurenGT/ufo_sightings/blob/main/level_2/index.html). Fill in the search criteria you are intersted in, and click the 'Filter Table' button at the bottom of the 'Filter Search' box.

When entering your search criteria, please use all lowercase letters and ensure your date format is M/D/YYYY. Note that the date range available in this table is 1/1/2010-1/13/2010, so you will not see results for dates outside of that range.

Happy searching!
